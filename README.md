<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

You're a developer and you want to ship your awesome application. It's easy and you have so much choice whether it's through Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify or the 1000 other PaaS. In most cases you sign up to a PaaS and do the following:

* Point to your repository
* ???
* Profit

Just to be clear, this is a great thing and it allows developers to focus on bringing value to their application.

I've often been curious about what goes on behind the hood though, especially when it comes to production environments. I hear of load balancing, nginx, caching, SSL termination, MTLS, configuring databases in Linux, security and all these other scary things when it comes to infrastructure. Also how do you configure the infrastructure to serve an application in production?

The point of this project is to help provide an understanding of infrastructure and to know a bit about what's being abstracted away by a PaaS.

One way of approaching this is to identify the individual components needed, like an nginx load balancer, sign up to a cloud provider like AWS, spin up an EC2 instance, ssh into it, install all of the necessary dependencies for nginx, install nginx and configuring nginx and using systemctl to restart the nginx service. This is a rather long winded, highly manual and it'll cost money.

So instead of EC2 instances, what if we could use vagrant machines on your local machine instead and assign an ip address to each vagrant machine? And instead of manually SSH'ing into your vagrant machine and configuring it each time, what if you could automate this process in an idempotent way? In fact, what if you could spin up a vagrant machine, install dependencies for nginx, install nginx, configure nginx, restart nginx and confirm it's all working in an automated and idempotent way?

My friends, this is what this project is all about. This project is an attempt for me to educate myself on what is generally required, from an infrastructure perspective and configuration perspective, to deploy a website that has a client, server and database. We'll be spinning up Vagrant machines and setting them all up to get an idea of what it takes to deploy an application and what a PaaS might be abstracting away from us.

The automation is achieved with Ansible, an automation tool by RedHat. Though we could use bash scripts to write our automation, coding for idempotency is notoriously difficult. Ansible is an industry standard tool for automation that handles idempotency so it only makes sense to use the right tool for the right job. Although I am aware of Chef and dabbled a bit in it, my preference is Ansible so that's what's being used here.

<br/>

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

# Pre requisite

Make sure you have installed:
1 - Ansible
2 - Vagrant

Also prepare for your laptop to sound like it's about to take off...especially if you're on an intel macbook pro

# Start

```
./start-vms.sh
```

# Destroy

```
./destroy-vms.sh
```

# Manual test

Enter the ip address of the frontend nginx server, found in infra/Vagrantfile

# Random notes

A few notes on ssh'ing or scp'ing into vagrant machine

If you ssh into the vagrant machine by using `vagrant ssh` and run:

`cat ~/.ssh/authroized_keys`

you'll see a list of public authorized public keys 

One is meant to have the private key in hand to be able to ssh or scp or do any shell related activity from one machine to the vagrant machine

So in the case of your local macbook ssh'ing into a locally spun up vagrant machine you could scp something over via:

`scp -i /Users/yournameprobably/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_keys/vagrant.key.rsa -P 2222 ./some_file.txt vagrant@127.0.0.1:/home/vagrant`

To ssh:

`ssh -i /Users/yournameprobably/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_keys/vagrant.key.rsa -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1`

# Things left to do

* Set up Kubernetes to orchestrate the frontend application rather than have systemd run the docker run command. If application fails, systemd would not restart the container. systemd is not a replacement for a container orchestrator. Edit: Because the frontend is only being run in one vagrant machine, there is no need for a container orchestrator for now. But if you REALLY want to experiment, you could try setting up nomad?
* Do a write up on various aspects of the project.
  * Provide diagram
  * write about the decision making for having an nginx server for the frontend
  * write about how to avoid CORS issues with nginx configurations for frontend and backend reverse proxies
* Enable MTLS. Shouldn't be able to just query ip address of server
* Django admin should be accessible via public internet.
* Django should create static assets and the nginx reverse proxy should serve them.
* Frontend container is
